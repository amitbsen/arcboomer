# ArcBoomer
A tool to help policy makers create strategies to address long-term-care in aging populations and help people learn more about their health care insurance plans, providers, and coverage information.


## Inspiration
The older population in the US growing.The number of seniors is expected to double in the next few decades. In the US, we rely on paid caregivers to watch over our elders. 

However, the costs for long-term care, the services that "help people live as independently and safely as possible when they can no longer perform everyday activities on their own" (https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-long-term-care) are expensive.

ArcBoomer provides two solutions to help address the growing population of elderly who need long-term care: (1) creating maps for policy makers to determine how to subsidize costs of long-term care and (2) help people find insurance plans. 

## How I built it
I built it with the ArcGIS Experience Builder and ArcGIS Online platform. I analyzed some of the data using ArcGIS Pro. The widget to Search insurance plans was created using React, TypeScript, and the Medicare Marketplace API.

## Challenges I ran into
There is a lot of information that policy makers need to be informed on. I found it hard to determine which factors to prioritize.

## What's next for r u ok boomer?
- More policy maps
- Better tools to help people find
